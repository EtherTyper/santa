Submit your present guidelines to Santa while learning encryption ideology, JSON notation, and even git workflow. The guide is still _**being wriiten**_, much less is it even being edited and proofread, so I'd suggest that people stay away unless if they're looking to make it better.

# Part I: For Parents
## Forking

The first thing you'll need to do with this repository to get it setup for your kids is to fork or clone your own copy, depending on how you intend to obtain it. Your kids have to main options: To do it via GitHub, which is the clean, easy system that rendered this README for you, and git, the CLI, or Command Line Interface, that GitHub does the nitty gritty on. I've found that GitHub is much easier to use than git for kids, taking away the confusion of remote versus local repositories and adding built in issue resolution systems. However, they've made some more important changes as well, including the removal of distinction between fast-forward and commit merging, and the requirement to "annotate" commits and tags. It's completely your choice to make.
